        <h2>About Our Initiative</h2>
        <p>Our initiative focuses on addressing the mental health challenges faced by informal workers in India. We believe that everyone deserves access to quality mental health support, regardless of their employment status.</p>
        <p>Informal workers, who make up a significant portion of India's workforce, often face unique stressors and barriers to accessing mental health care. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Financial Instability:</strong> Many informal workers lack a steady income, making it difficult to afford healthcare services.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Awareness:</strong> There is often little awareness about mental health issues and available resources among informal workers.</li>
            <li><strong>Stigma:</strong> Social stigma surrounding mental health can prevent individuals from seeking help.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Access:</strong> Many informal workers live in remote areas where mental health services are scarce or non-existent.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Our Mission and Goals</h3>
        <p>We aim to raise awareness about the mental health needs of informal workers and advocate for better resources and services. Our goals include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increasing access to affordable mental health services.</li>
            <li>Providing education and resources to informal workers about mental health.</li>
            <li>Advocating for policy changes that support mental health initiatives for vulnerable populations.</li>
            <li>Creating community support networks to foster connection and reduce isolation.</li>
        </ul>
