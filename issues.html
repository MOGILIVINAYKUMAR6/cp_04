        <h2>Key Challenges Facing Informal Workers</h2>
        <section class="issue">
            <h3>Financial Instability</h3>
            <p>Informal workers often face unpredictable income streams, leading to chronic stress and anxiety about meeting basic needs. This financial insecurity can have severe impacts on mental health, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased risk of depression and anxiety disorders</li>
                <li>Difficulty in planning for the future, leading to feelings of hopelessness</li>
                <li>Strain on personal relationships due to financial stress</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="issue">
            <h3>Lack of Social Protection</h3>
            <p>Without formal employment contracts, informal workers often lack access to essential social protections, which can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased vulnerability to economic shocks and health crises</li>
                <li>Absence of sick leave or paid time off, forcing workers to choose between health and income</li>
                <li>No access to unemployment benefits or job security, causing constant worry about job loss</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="issue">
            <h3>Poor Working Conditions</h3>
            <p>Many informal workers face hazardous or stressful working environments, which can significantly impact their mental health:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exposure to physical hazards without proper safety equipment</li>
                <li>Long working hours and lack of work-life balance</li>
                <li>Lack of autonomy and control over work tasks</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="issue">
            <h3>Limited Access to Healthcare</h3>
            <p>Informal workers often struggle to access adequate healthcare, including mental health services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of health insurance or inability to afford medical care</li>
                <li>Limited availability of mental health professionals in rural or underserved areas</li>
                <li>Stigma surrounding mental health issues preventing workers from seeking help</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="issue">
            <h3>Social Stigma and Isolation</h3>
            <p>Informal workers may face social stigma and isolation due to their employment status:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of recognition and respect for their work contributions</li>
                <li>Exclusion from social networks and community support systems</li>
                <li>Feelings of shame or inadequacy due to societal perceptions of informal work</li>
            </ul>
